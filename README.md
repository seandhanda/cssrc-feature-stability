# Feature Stability Under Resampled Training Sets

This repository contains code to reproduce the experiments and figures from the paper:

**Accuracy Is Not Enough: Evaluating Feature Stability Across Resampled Training Sets**  
Sean Dhanda, University of British Columbia

## Overview
We evaluate predictive accuracy and feature importance stability for logistic regression and random forest models under repeated train/test resampling on a tabular classification dataset.

## Requirements
Python 3.9+

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
